How to run
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run this project, you need to have Node.js installed, and create an .env file at the FakeTube`s root folder, and then copy the .env.example content to the newly created .env.

After that, if you run the command "node ace serve --watch" without quotes, it should work properly.
